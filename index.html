                    ABOUT US</h1>
                <P>Mercedes-Benz commonly referred to as Mercedes and sometimes as Benz, is a German luxury and
                    commercial vehicle automotive brand
                    established in 1926. Mercedes-Benz AG (a Mercedes-Benz Group subsidiary established in 2019) is
                    headquartered in Stuttgart, Baden-Württemberg, Germany. Mercedes-Benz AG produces consumer luxury
                    vehicles and light commercial vehicles badged as Mercedes-Benz. From November 2019 onwards,
                    Mercedes-Benz-badged heavy commercial vehicles (trucks and buses) are managed by Daimler Truck, a
                    former part of the Mercedes-Benz Group turned into an independent company in late 2021. In 2018,
                    Mercedes-Benz was the largest brand of premium vehicles in the world, having sold 2.31 million
                    passenger cars.The brand's origins lie in Daimler-Motoren-Gesellschaft's 1901 Mercedes and Carl
                    Benz's 1886 Benz Patent-Motorwagen, which is widely regarded as the first internal combustion engine
                    in a self-propelled automobile. The slogan for the brand is "the Best or Nothing".

                <p>From 1937 onward, Daimler Benz focused increasingly on military products such as the LG3000 lorry and
                    the DB600 and the DB601 aero engines. To build the latter, in 1936, it built a factory hidden in the
                    forest at Genshagen around 10 km south of Berlin. By 1942, the company had mostly stopped producing
                    cars, and was now devoted to war production. According to its statement, in 1944, almost half of its
                    63,610 employees were forced labourers, prisoners of war, or concentration-camp detainees.[16]
                    Another source quotes this figure at 46,000. The company later paid $12 million in reparations to
                    the labourers' families.[17]

                    In 1958, the two companies began a partnership to sell their cars in the United States with
                    Studebaker. A few American-based Daimler Benz dealerships were converted into Mercedes-Benz
                    dealerships when Daimler's non-Mercedes-partnered company closed in 1966.

                    Over the decades, Mercedes-Benz has introduced many electronic and mechanical innovations and safety
                    features that later became common.[18] Currently, Mercedes-Benz is one of the best-known and
                    longest-standing automotive brands in the world. The pontiff's Popemobile has often been sourced
                    from Mercedes-Benz.[15]

                    In November 2019, Daimler AG announced that Mercedes-Benz, until that point a company marque, would
                    be spun off into a separate, wholly owned subsidiary called Mercedes-Benz AG. The new subsidiary
                    would manage the Mercedes-Benz car and van business. Mercedes-Benz-badged trucks and buses would be
                    part of the Daimler Truck AG subsidiary.Gottlieb Daimler was born on 17 March 1834 in Schorndorf.
                    After training as a gunsmith and working in France, he attended the Polytechnic School in Stuttgart
                    from 1857 to 1859. After completing various technical activities in France and England, he started
                    working as a draftsman in Geislingen in 1862. At the end of 1863, he was appointed workshop
                    inspector at a machine-tool factory in Reutlingen, where he met Wilhelm Maybach in 1865.[13]

                    Throughout the 1930s, Mercedes-Benz produced the 770 model, a car that was notably popular
                    throughout Germany's Nazi period. Adolf Hitler was known to have driven in a model of this car
                    during his time in power, with modified custom bulletproof windshields.[14] Most of the currently
                    surviving 770 models were sold at auctions to private buyers. One of the cars is currently on
                    display at the War Museum in Ottawa, Ontario</p>
